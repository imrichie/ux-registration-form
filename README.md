### Design Decisions

- **Microcopy**: Chose conversational and friendly language to make the experience feel warm and inviting, rather than dry and formal.
- **Password Feedback**: The password field includes real-time feedback, providing users with checkmarks as they meet each criterion (uppercase, lowercase, number, minimum length). This makes security requirements feel approachable.
- **Subtle Animations**: Added smooth transitions for form focus states, checkmark animations, and button interactions to make the form feel dynamic and responsive.
- **Confirmation Screen**: A simple, animated success message provides closure and makes the end of the interaction memorable.

### Technologies Used
